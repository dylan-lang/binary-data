binary-data
===========

This is binary-data, consisting of a domain-specific language for
describing binary protocols, which generates readers and writers into a
high-level object.

The overall goal is to be able to write definitions of binary data in an
easy to understand manner.

This project used ideas from the defstorage system available as part of
the `Genera Common Lisp operating system`_.

The documentation for this project is viewable online at
http://opendylan.org/documentation/binary-data/.

There are two papers about this project:

* `Secure networking <documentation/papers/secure-networking.pdf>`_ [2006]
* `A domain-specific language for manipulation of binary data in Dylan <documentation/papers/a-DSL-for-manipulation-of-binary-data.pdf>`_ [2007]
